HTTPS SUPPORT STATUS
====================

CURRENT STATUS: ❌ HTTPS NOT CONFIGURED

ANALYSIS
--------
1. nginx.conf
   - Only listens on port 80 (HTTP)
   - No SSL/TLS configuration
   - No certificate paths defined
   - No HTTPS server block

2. docker-compose.yml
   - Port 443 exposed but not used
   - No SSL certificate volumes mounted

3. SSL Certificates
   - No .pem, .crt, or .key files found
   - No certificate directory structure

4. FastAPI Configuration
   - No SSL certificate paths in config.py
   - No HTTPS settings in main.py
   - Uvicorn runs on HTTP only

5. Backend Service
   - Direct access on port 8000 is HTTP only
   - No SSL/TLS termination configured

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------

OPTION 1: Configure Nginx with SSL (Recommended)
-------------------------------------------------
1. Obtain SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt or commercial)
2. Update nginx.conf to add HTTPS server block
3. Mount certificates in docker-compose.yml
4. Redirect HTTP to HTTPS

OPTION 2: Use Reverse Proxy with SSL
-------------------------------------
1. Deploy behind Cloudflare, AWS ALB, or similar
2. SSL termination at proxy level
3. Backend remains HTTP internally

OPTION 3: Direct FastAPI HTTPS
-------------------------------
1. Configure uvicorn with SSL certificates
2. Update main.py to use SSL
3. Requires certificates on server

IMMEDIATE FIX FOR MIXED CONTENT ERROR
--------------------------------------
Since backend doesn't support HTTPS, frontend should:
1. Use HTTP when accessing from HTTP page
2. Use HTTPS API endpoint (if available via proxy)
3. Or configure environment variable VITE_API_BASE_URL

Current frontend config will try HTTPS when page is HTTPS,
but backend will reject it since SSL is not configured.
