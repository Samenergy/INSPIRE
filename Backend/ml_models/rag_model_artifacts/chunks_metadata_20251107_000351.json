It's about meeting communities where they are and walking with them toward new opportunities. To help strengthen long-term impact, we also donated 10 desktops to the local hub in Rubavu to expand access to technology for the surrounding community. #ConnectingAtTheRoots #DoingForTomorrowToday"

Our CEO, Monzer A., contributed to a powerful discussion alongside government leaders, academics, and private sector representatives on how to strengthen collaboration between higher learning institutions and industry. The event focused on the urgent need to close the gap between academic training and labour market needs and to ensure that graduates are equipped with the right skills to succeed in an evolving economy. As Hon. Minister Ambassador Christine Nkulikiyinka emphasized: \u201cIt\u2019s not just a matter of having data, it\u2019s about how we use it to inform meaningful change.
