## 🎯 **Key Improvements:**

### **1. Description from "What is..." Query** ⭐

**Before:**
```
Extract from news articles
→ "MTN Rwanda has announced..."
→ "This performance highlights..."
→ ❌ About announcements, not what company IS
```

**After:**
```
Search: "What is MTN Rwanda in Rwanda"
→ Knowledge Graph: "MTN Rwanda is a leading telecommunications company..."
→ Wikipedia: "MTN Rwanda operates as mobile network operator since 1998..."
→ ✅ Actual company description!
```

###**2. Strengths from Overview Text** ⭐ **NEW!**

**Sources for strengths:**

**Priority 1: SerpAPI "What is..." Results**
- Knowledge Graph data (revenue, employees, market position)
- Wikipedia overview (history, achievements, notable facts)
- Answer Box content (key information)
- **Quality: EXCELLENT** ✅

**Priority 2: News Articles**
- Recent achievements
- New partnerships
- Growth metrics
- **Quality: GOOD** ✅

**Combined & Deduplicated!**

---

### **3. Weaknesses ONLY from News**

**News articles are BEST for:**
- ✅ Recent challenges
- ✅ Regulatory issues
- ✅ Competition concerns
- ✅ Operational problems

**Wikipedia/Knowledge Graph DON'T have weaknesses** (they're neutral/positive)

## 📊 **Example: Amazon**

### **Step 1: Search "What is Amazon in USA"**

**Knowledge Graph Returns:**
```
{
  "title": "Amazon.com, Inc.",

  "founded": "July 5, 1994",
  "headquarters": "Seattle, Washington",
  "ceo": "Andy Jassy",
  "revenue": "$574.8 billion (2023)",
  "employees": "1,541,000",
  "products": ["Amazon Web Services", "Prime Video", "Kindle", "Alexa", "Whole Foods"]
}
```

- ✅ "Multinational technology company" → **Market position**

**These are REAL strengths from authoritative sources!**
